# R & RStudio Setup

This is the repo I maintain that keeps my R & RStudio preferences. This initially came out of my job where I have to log into different servers for my clients. I wanted to copy over all of my settings so I have the same coding & IDE experience regardless of which machine I'm using. After a little bit of research, I didn't find any packages/methods to quickly copy over my preferred settings, so I made this script.

Feel free to fork and customize for your own needs!
